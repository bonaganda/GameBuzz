                <h2>Platform: PS4</h2></br>
                Uncharted 4 is an adventure-action packed game that is played from a third-person perspective, with platform game elements. 
                The player undertakes control of Nathan Drake, who is physically adept and is able to sprint, climb, jump, swim, scale narrow ledges and wall-faces to get amongst points, swing with a rope, use a grappling hook and do other acrobatic actions. 
                Drake can use different weapons such as assault rifles, grenades and pistols to kill his enemies. 
                Another feature that was incorporated in the game is the stealth elements which allows the player to sneak up to enemies and kill them without even being noticed. 
                The melee combat system was revised to evade the presence of quick time events and Drake can directly control the vehicles.</br></br>

                <br><br>So while the game is linear, the environments feature various pathways for the player to discover. 
                The maps are considerably larger than the preceding games in the franchise, with the explorable region being 10 times greater than the previous games. 
                The enemies’ AI (artificial intelligence) is improved as they can now respond to the player’s actions more responsively, cooperate with each other and coordinate the tactics. 
                The AI of Drake’s companions, Sully and Sam are enhanced and they help Nathan in situations where there is combat, though the player can’t directly command them to do so. 
                Another feature that was introduced is the dialogue tree although this doesn’t affect the progression of the story. </br></br>

                <br><br>Additionally, the changeover between the gameplay sequences and the cutscene is rather seamless. Competitive multiplayer is also featured in the game. 
                Lastly, there are certain things that can be unlocked in the game by using the points that the player has collected during the game are additional modes and visual filters, zero gravity mode, cel-shaded  artstyle and bullet time gameplay. </br></br>
