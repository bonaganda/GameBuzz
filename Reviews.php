                            One of my favourite games of all time is Warhammer: Shadow of the Horned Rat. It’s available on GOG now, and while it’s not quite an old game, it remains deeply playable. The secret to its enduring success is the variety of the units, as well as your ability to take ownership of them because they all have individual names and accumulate experience.

                            Quadrilateral Cowboy is a unique environmental puzzle game developed by Blendo Games and available now on Steam. It’s already raked in tonnes of acclaim from some of the top dogs in the industry, and I’ve been kind of excited, albeit a little apprehensive to dive into it in earnest.

                            While I’ve generally enjoyed Blizzard’s output for quite some time, like most, I wasn’t entirely sure of what to expect with Overwatch. While Blizzard has certainly made a name for themselves in RTS / RPG circles over their many, many years of existence, a team-based shooter didn’t exactly seem like a perfect match to me.

                            Sneaking through the forest, a child running for his life serves as the main protagonist of Inside. Running further into the forest, it becomes apparent that the boy is running from an ominous threat. Having to sneak past trucks filled to the brim with mindless people that are being shipped off to an unforeseen destination, you are given a sense that everything is not ok.

                             Just Cause 3 is the latest instalment in the infamous Just Cause series, which is famous for being the video game equivalent of a bull in a china shop. With heat-seeking grenades. And a parachute. Where the china explodes easily. So it’s quite a lot of fun.

                            The trouble with trilogies is that they almost never end at three. The same kind of thinking that assumes three parts will be necessary to tell a single story will inevitably need a fourth and fifth shot at getting things right. In that way, “Uncharted 4: A Thief’s End” feels as inevitable as it does unnecessary.

                                We’ve never heard anyone talk about League of Legends or Dota in real life. We don’t know any friends that play them and we don’t even recall any fellow journos discussing them. Nor do we remember anyone writing into the Inbox about them. And yet on any given day they have over 10 million people playing them, and the mere announcement of Dota 2’s existence was enough to crash the websites reporting it.
