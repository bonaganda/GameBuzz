                This game was developed by ID sotware, which was the studio that had pioneered the genre of first-person shooting and developed a multiplayer deathmatch. DOOM returns as a fun but brutal and challenging modern-day shooter experience. There are relentless demons, unbelievably destructive guns and very fast, fluid movement provide the grounds for an intense, first-person combat – whether you are destroying hordes of demons in Hell in the single-player mode or competing with your friends in several multiplayer modes. You can also easily create, play and share your content with the world by using the DOOM SnapMap game editor. </br></br>

                The game is essentially in a Union Aerospace Corporation’s massive research facility located in Mars. It has been overwhelmed by powerful and ferocious demons and only one person stands between their world and the world of humans. The player is the lone DOOM Marine and has been activated to do one thing which is to kill all of them.
                A key feature of the game is the relentless campaign. In this game, there isn’t any taking cover or stopping to regenerate the player’s health as he/she beats the Hell’s raging demon hordes. Iconic guns, upgrades, movement and an advanced melee system to knock-down, crush, stomp, slash, and blow the demons apart in violent and creative ways. </br></br>

                Next, there is a return of the id Multiplayer. The player can dominate his/her opponents in DOOM’s signature, fast-paced arena-style combat. In both of the classic and all-new game modes, they can annihilate their enemies by utilizing their personal blend of skill, powerful weapons, vertical movement and exclusive power-ups that enable them to play as a demon. </br> </br>
