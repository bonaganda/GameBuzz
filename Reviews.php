                            One of my favourite games of all time is Warhammer: Shadow of the Horned Rat. It’s available on GOG now, and while it’s not quite an old game, it remains deeply playable. The secret to its enduring success is the variety of the units, as well as your ability to take ownership of them because they all have individual names and accumulate experience.

                            Quadrilateral Cowboy is a unique environmental puzzle game developed by Blendo Games and available now on Steam. It’s already raked in tonnes of acclaim from some of the top dogs in the industry, and I’ve been kind of excited, albeit a little apprehensive to dive into it in earnest.

                            While I’ve generally enjoyed Blizzard’s output for quite some time, like most, I wasn’t entirely sure of what to expect with Overwatch. While Blizzard has certainly made a name for themselves in RTS / RPG circles over their many, many years of existence, a team-based shooter didn’t exactly seem like a perfect match to me.

                            Sneaking through the forest, a child running for his life serves as the main protagonist of Inside. Running further into the forest, it becomes apparent that the boy is running from an ominous threat. Having to sneak past trucks filled to the brim with mindless people that are being shipped off to an unforeseen destination, you are given a sense that everything is not ok.

                            Inside is a puzzle platformer in which the player is a young boy who wears a red shirt and explores a surreal setting presented as a predominantly monochromatic 2.5D platform game using colour only to highlight parts of the setting. The game itself is very dark in nature and regularly silent, with only intermittent musical cues.
