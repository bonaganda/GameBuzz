                    <h2>Number 10</h2>
                    <a href="Games/JustCause3.php"><h3>Just Cause 3 - Score: 8.4 </h3></a>
                    <a href="Games/JustCause3.php"><img src="Images/jc3.jpg" style="width: 675px; height: 400px;"></a>
                    <p>Just Cause 3 is a playground where you get to be a physics-defying force of destruction, and its loop of liberating dozens
                        of towns across this enormous scenic world would’ve gotten old much quicker if the combat wasn’t so full of options for free-form mayhem. Getting the most out of it requires some  
                        creativity and tolerance for performance bugs on your part, so come expecting to make at least some of your own fun. We gave it a score of 8.4, making it's spot at number 10. </p>
                </div>

                    <a href="Games/Dota2.php"><img src="Images/d2.jpg" style="width: 675px; height: 400px;  "></a>
                    <p>Dota 2 deserves its intimidating reputation, and it probably won’t suit you if you’re looking to play casually. 
                        There’s a huge time investment before you can even enjoy a game, let alone feel competent at it. But once you start to learn its secrets, 
                        there’s a wild and exciting variety of play here that’s unmatched, even by its peers. It’s a challenge of knowledge as well as reflexes, and 
                        success is a rush. The fact that it’s completely and totally free to play in the way we wish all free-to-play games could be isn’t just one of 
                        the most generous propositions anywhere in gaming, it creates a level playing field where skill and cooperation is paramount. With this, we have 
                        scored Dota 2 a decent 8.5, overtaking Just Cause 3 for the number 9 spot.</p>

                    <h2>Number 8</h2>
                    <a href="Games/Uncharted4.php"><h3>Uncharted 4 - Score 8.8</h3></a>
                    <a href="Games/Uncharted4.php"><img src="Images/uncharted4.jpg" style="width: 675px; height: 400px;"></a>
                    <p>Uncharted 4: A Thief’s End is a remarkable achievement in blockbuster storytelling and graphical beauty. 
                        Though it’s  let down by a lack of imagination and some self-indulgence, especially in a third act that drags on far too long, 
                        Uncharted 4 carries on the series’ proud tradition of peerless polish and style, with a great multiplayer component to boot. Most importantly, 
                        it’s a gentle sendoff to the rag-tag group of characters we’ve known for nine years. For this game, we gave it an 8.8. A worthy thief’s end, indeed. </p>

                    <h2>Number 7</h2>
                    <a href="Games/HeartsOfIron4.php"><h3>Hearts of Iron IV -Score: 8.9</h3></a>
                    <a href="Games/HeartsOfIron4.php"><img src="Images/soldier.jpg" style="width: 675px; height: 400px;"></a>
                    <p>You get a beautiful, thrilling wargame out of that bargain. While we found a number of flaws when we stood close to the tapestry, 
                        it's important to remember that Hearts of Iron 4 exists to encompass the whole sweep of the war. It captivates us because—imperfectly, 
                        impressionistically, and perhaps a little amorally—it lets us orchestrate the most titanic armed struggles in history, from the fussy economic 
                        details to the cut-and-thrust of mechanized warfare. There are other great strategic-level wargames out there. But we have never played anything 
                        like Hearts of Iron 4, and for that we gave it a whopping 8.9 as the score to take the number 7 spot! </p>

                    <h2>Number 6</h2>
                    <a href="Games/Overwatch.php"><h3>Overwatch - Score: 9.0</h3></a>
                    <a href="Games/Overwatch.php"><img src="Images/ow.jpg" style="width: 675px; height: 400px;"></a>
                    <p>Overwatch is an incredible achievement in multiplayer shooter design. It bobs and weaves almost perfectly between being the quick-fix 
                        adrenaline hit you might want after a long day of work, and the thoughtful, strategic multiplayer experience that becomes the center of 
                        evening-long binges with friends. It might not have the most exhaustive list of maps and modes, but it provides nearly endless opportunities 
                        for exhilarating, coordinated play, and when you’re the one at the center of it, it feels like nothing else. Overwatch was a very solid game, 
                        and we gave it a flat solid score of 9.0. </p>
