                            One of my favourite games of all time is Warhammer: Shadow of the Horned Rat. It’s available on GOG now, and while it’s not quite an old game, it remains deeply playable. The secret to its enduring success is the variety of the units, as well as your ability to take ownership of them because they all have individual names and accumulate experience.

                            Quadrilateral Cowboy is a unique environmental puzzle game developed by Blendo Games and available now on Steam. It’s already raked in tonnes of acclaim from some of the top dogs in the industry, and I’ve been kind of excited, albeit a little apprehensive to dive into it in earnest.

                            This game was developed by ID sotware, which was the studio that had pioneered the genre of first-person shooting and developed a multiplayer deathmatch. DOOM returns as a fun but brutal and challenging modern-day shooter experience.

                            Inside is a puzzle platformer in which the player is a young boy who wears a red shirt and explores a surreal setting presented as a predominantly monochromatic 2.5D platform game using colour only to highlight parts of the setting. The game itself is very dark in nature and regularly silent, with only intermittent musical cues.
