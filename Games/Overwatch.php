                Overwatch is a team based shooter from renowned games studio, Blizzard. What sets this shooter apart from the rest is that there is a wide range of heroes for the player to fight with. 
                Each hero has their own set of abilities that the player can master. There are a lot of characters in the game that the player can choose from such as Volatile Mercenary, Super-Intelligent Genetically Engineered Gorilla or Cyborg Ninja. 
                The game is essentially all about teamwork so the player would need to know what his/her role and excel in it. 
                Whether the player is defending their team mates with energy shields, one of the people in action, or supporting their team mates by intensifying their damage attack to their enemy. Every hero has a role to fill in the game.</br></br>

                <br><br>There are soldiers, adventurers, scientists and other oddities created and during a global crisis, an international task force encompassed of heroes from all over the globe were tasked with restoring the peace to the world that has been torn apart because of war. 
                Therefore, their name is called Overwatch. After the crisis have been prevented, they tried to maintain the peace for as long as they can and for years to come but in the end, Overwatch’s influence of doing so has weakened and they have parted.</br></br>
