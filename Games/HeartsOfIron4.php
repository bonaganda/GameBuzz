                <h2>Platform: PC</h2></br>
                Hearts of Iron IV is a strategy game where the player is able to take command of any nation in World War II which is the most engaging conflict in world history and the player can lead the nation with their chosen ultimate weapon. 
                From the heart of the battlefield to the centre of command, the player will need to guide his/her nation to glory and wage war, invade or negotiate. 
                The power is fundamentally with the player to tip the very balance of World War II. 
                The question now is will the player relive or change the history? Will the player change the fate of the world by accomplishing victory no matter the costs? It is time to show and test the player’s ability as the supreme military leader in the world.</br></br>

                <br><br>The main features of the game is that it is a game where there is total strategic war. War is not only won in the land but so as the sea and in the air. It’s also accomplished in the minds and hearts of both men and women. 
                Next is the simulation of authentic real-time war: fight the wars with various range of tools available such as planes, ships, tanks, guns and even the newly discovered weapons of mass destruction. 
                The player is also given the option to choose which nation he/she would want to control and manage – either the small nations or the nations which are striving for power and glory to achieve victory. 
                In addition, the game has a topographical map complete with seasons, terrain and weather so that the players can experience the full World War II timespan. Storms, mud and snow can either be the player’s enemy or their strongest ally.</br></br>
