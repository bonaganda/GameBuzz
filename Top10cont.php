            <h1>Top 5 - 1</h1>
            <h2> Here are the best of the bests in the world of games!</br> </br></h2>
            <h1>Number 5</h1>
            <h2> INSIDE - Score: 9.1 </h2>
            <a href="Games/Inside.php"><img src="Images/inside.jpg" style="width: 675px; height: 400px;  "></a>
            <p>Inside very clearly builds upon what made Limbo great, and in fact builds something greater. Its unimaginable twist </br> may leave you dumbfounded, confused, and quite possibly speechless, but it will fuel heated discussion with your friends </br>about its meaning, its message, and its intentions. It’s a short ride, but one I felt compelled to take again – including a search </br> for its mysterious hidden orb collectibles. Play it soon before anyone spoils a single big moment for you. For us, its a 9.1 outta 10. </p>
          
         
            </br></br>
             <h1>Number 4 </h1>
             <h2> Dark Souls 3 - Score: 9.3 </h2>
             <a href="Games/DarkSouls3.php"><img src="Images/ds.jpg" style="width: 675px; height: 400px;  "></a>
             <p>If Dark Souls 3 truly is the last in the series as we know it, then it’s a worthy send-off. Weapon arts allow stylish and </br> versatile new moves without tarnishing the purity of the combat system. Lothric’s awe-inspiring locations provide visually </br> stunning arenas for rigorous exploration and fierce face-offs with hosts of deadly enemies and even deadlier bosses. </br> While not all the risky changes land as neatly as others, Dark Souls 3 is a powerful journey and the sequel the series truly </br> deserves. A must play for action game lovers out there, and a solid 9.3.</p>
             
             
             </br></br> 
             <h1>Number 3</h1>
             <h2>Doom - Score 9.4</h2>
             <a href="Games/Doom.php"><img src="Images/doom.jpg" style="width: 675px; height: 400px;"></a>
             <p>Doom is a tale of two very different shooters (and one quirky creation tool). The single-player campaign's reverent worship </br> of the series' roots results in an old-school run-and-gun shooter which feels like imitation Doom, a cover of an old hit which </br> nails all the right power chords but isn't exactly transformative. The multiplayer's attempts to borrow from the new to </br> reinvigorate the old results in an experience which won't satisfy either school of thought. SnapMap, meanwhile, is a blend </br> of weird and simple and endearing. </p>
             
             </br></br>
             <h1>Number 2</h1>
             <h2>Quadrilateral Cowboy - Score: 9.6</h2>
             <a href="Games/QuadrilateralCowboy.php"><img src="Images/cowboy.jpg" style="width: 675px; height: 400px;"></a>
             <p>Quadrilateral Cowboy’s puzzles are mostly a joy to play. Its command line hacking is surprisingly accessible and pleasingly </br> tactile, and when combined with its many interesting gadgets it allows for plenty of creative problem-solving and freedom </br> in tackling all manner of whimsical cybercrime. While not all of its levels shine as brightly as the rest, I’m already feeling </br> beckoned back by its replayability and charm, eager to experiment more with the futuristic, hacker-themed playground </br> it so stylishly constructs. This intrigued are interest, and we recommend this for you to try as well. This game gets the </br> number 2 spot with a score of 9.6! </p>

             </br></br>
             <h1>Number 1</h1>
             <h2>Total War: Warhammer - Score: 10</h2>
             <a href="Games/Warhammer.php"><img src="Images/war.jpg" style="width: 675px; height: 400px;"></a>
             <p>Total War: Warhammer is brimming with exciting ideas, interesting characters, and outright, skull-stompingly delightful </br>units and faction mechanics. The current roster of starting positions in the campaign feels thin, but each army therein is a </br> distinctly different experience. Some factions (Vampire Counts, Greenskins) are more fun than others (Dwarfs), but none </br>feel underdeveloped or unfinished. Deep hero progression and a well-executed Chaos invasion round out a campaign that,</br> while it has some flaws in set-up and pacing, fulfilled all of my deepest fantasies of seeing giant, impossible armies clashing </br> amidst the shrieking of griffins and the glow of flaming meteors summoned from the sky. It’s just a damn good time.</br> This game grabs our top spot at number 1 with a perfect score of 10!</p>
