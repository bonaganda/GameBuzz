                Hearts of Iron IV is a strategy game where the player is able to take command of any nation in World War II which is the most engaging conflict in world history and the player can lead the nation with their chosen ultimate weapon. 
                From the heart of the battlefield to the centre of command, the player will need to guide his/her nation to glory and wage war, invade or negotiate. 
                The power is fundamentally with the player to tip the very balance of World War II. 
                The question now is will the player relive or change the history? Will the player change the fate of the world by accomplishing victory no matter the costs? It is time to show and test the player’s ability as the supreme military leader in the world.</br></br>
